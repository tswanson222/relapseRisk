R package for predicting risk of relapse for anorexia nervosa recovery. UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

## Background

The following documents demonstrate analyses involved in the construction and evaluation of the machine learning algorithm used to predict recovery outcomes in patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. To view these \code{.html} files, the user must download the raw files and then open them in a local web browser. 

[EPSI_thetaAnalysis](./EPSI_thetaAnalysis.html) contains an overview of the initial analysis that led to the construction of this package. This involved analyzing data from previous research on eating disorder patients who completed the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory (EPSI) during treatment, and were then re-evalued by therapists during a 6-month and 12-month follow-up to determine whether they had relapsed based on their body-mass index (BMI), number of binge-eating episodes (BE), and compensatory episodes (CE). The objective was to determine whether higher-order factors derived from the patients' EPSI responses were useful in predicting their recovery outcomes. 

[fullAnalysis](./fullAnalysls.html) contains an analysis of the training data used to construct the machine learning algorithm that predicts the risk of relapse for new patients diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate multiple resampling algorithms and performance outcomes to select the model that best predicts recovery outcomes within the training data. The model selected based on these results will then be used in our current research to predict patients' risk of relapse over the course of a 12-week randomized controlled trial (RCT). Upon re-assessing patients at a 6-month follow-up, results are then aggregated with the training data to further refine the algorithm and improve prediction for future patients.
